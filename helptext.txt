==================== HELP GUIDE ====================

Welcome to DW's Speech to Text converter!
This program allows you to transcribe your speech into text and save it to a file.
Follow the instructions below to use the program:

1. **Basic Commands**:
   - To request these instructions again, say "Help" at any time.
   - To quit and stop transcription, say "Quit" when you're done.

2. **File Options**:
   - You will be asked whether you want to "Overwrite" or "Add" to an existing file.
     - If you want to overwrite the file's content, say "One".
     - If you want to add text to the end of the file, say "Two".

3. **Choosing a File**:
   - After selecting how to handle the file (overwrite or add), you will be prompted to provide the file's name.
   - Just speak the name of the file (without the extension), and the program will save your text there. It will automatically add the `.txt` extension.

4. **Transcribing Speech**:
   - Once the file is selected, the program will continuously listen for your voice and convert it into text.
   - After each phrase, the text will be saved to the file.
   - Say "Quit" to stop transcription and close the program.

5. **Setting up WitAI**
   - Go to Wit.ai 
   - Click Continue with Meta
   - Follow instructions and create a free account
   - Click New App, name it, and click create
   - Under app settings, click Understanding
   - Scroll to "Try the HTTP API"
   - Find the following:
      curl ^
         -H "Authorization: Bearer QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMQWERTY" ^
         "https://api.wit.ai/message?v=**********="
   - Copy the unique 32 character string that is after the word "BEARER" from the above
   - In the same folder with main.py, create a file called .env
   - In this file, write the following:
      API_KEY=QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMQWERTY
   - Enjoy  
   - IMPORTANT: If you want to push this project to your github, make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file


Remember, you need an active internet connection to use this program, as it relies on WitAI's Speech Recognition API to convert speech to text.
